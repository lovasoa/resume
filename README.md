# Ophir LOJKINE

This is my resume :) Because I'm a total geek, it's in JSON, but you can view it rendered online at https://ophir.dev or download it [as a PDF](https://ophir.dev/resume.pdf).

This repository is powered by a CI running on github actions: every time the resume is updated, it is rendered and deployed to ophir.dev.
